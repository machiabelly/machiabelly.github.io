# Plugins

Polygonjs is designed to be easily extensible. This means you can create and add your own nodes. You can create those nodes from scratch, or you can also import any library from the npm ecosytem!

A proper documentation to create your own plugins is still in progress, but here is [a small tutorial](https://github.com/polygonjs/plugins_tutorials) to start with.

And here is the list of currently existing plugins:

-   [IFC](plugins/ifc)
-   [Mapbox](plugins/mapbox)
-   [Marker Tracking](plugins/marker-tracking)
-   [Occlusion](plugins/occlusion)
-   [Trace](plugins/trace)
