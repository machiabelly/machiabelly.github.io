## What is Polygonjs?

Polygonjs is a 3D design tool for the web. It helps you create interactive and realtime 3D scenes, which you can share with just a link.

People typically create 3D scenes for:

-   product configurators
-   playful landing pages
-   interactive artworks
-   scientific visualisations

And there are many other types of projects you can create with it. As long as it's interactive and on the web, Polygonjs can help you.

## How does Polygonjs work?

Polygonjs is fully node-based. This means that anything is done by creating nodes and connecting them together.

Nodes are specialized in different types of tasks:

-   Some are specialized in [creating geometries](/docs/nodes/sop).
-   Others in [creating materials](/docs/nodes/mat).
-   Some in [adding behaviors](/docs/nodes/sop/actor) to your objects.
-   And there are [several other types](/docs/nodes) as well.

There are 2 main advantages of creating scenes with a node-based system:

-   It gives you **a non-destructible workflow**: This means that you can always go back and change your mind, by either removing nodes or bypassing them. It makes it much easier to keep improving your scene. It is very different to a tool where you'd have to start from scratch or just undo many times.

-   You can **isolate specific parts** of your scene: If you're not sure how a specific node works, you can always copy/paste it into a new scene and test it out in isolation. This allows you to really understand how things work, and how to best use them.
