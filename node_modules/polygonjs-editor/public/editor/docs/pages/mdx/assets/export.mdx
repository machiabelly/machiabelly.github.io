# [Export Assets](/docs/assets) / Models

## Available Formats

Even though you'll make best use of Polygonjs by [exporting a full interactive scene](/docs/export), you may at times prefer to export a static asset.

In order to do so, when inside the [SOP context](/docs/nodes/sop), you have access to exporter nodes. To access them, simply open the `Tab Menu`, and start typing `exporter` to see the available nodes.

Here is the current list:

<DocImage src="docs/export_assets/export_nodes.jpg" alt="Export Nodes" />

Using those, you will be able to export in the following formats:

-   GLTF
-   OBJ
-   PLY
-   STL
-   STEP

Note that each of those format by also be imported via a file node.
