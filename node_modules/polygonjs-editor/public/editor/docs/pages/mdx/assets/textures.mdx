# [Import Assets](/docs/assets) / Textures

## From a Url

Importing textures is very similar to importing models. Let's start by creating a `compositing network` node, by selecting `networks -> copNetwork`

<DocImage src="docs/import_assets/create_cop_network_obj_node.jpg" alt="Create COP Network Obj Node" />

Once you have create this node, double click on it to go inside, and create an `image` node.

<DocImage src="docs/import_assets/create_image_cop_node.jpg" alt="Create Image COP Node" />

Then you will see, just like for the `file SOP` node, a `url` parameter. This is where the texture is loaded from.

<DocImage src="docs/import_assets/image_cop_params.jpg" alt="Image COP params" />

And to check that it is correctly loaded, you can middle click on the node, and that will preview the texture:

Now that the texture is imported, you still need to assign it to a material. Let's do this.

First we go back to the top node.

<DocImage src="docs/import_assets/go_to_top.jpg" alt="Go to top" />

Let's create a `Materials Network` node:

<DocImage src="docs/import_assets/create_mat_network_obj_node.jpg" alt="Create a Mat Network Node" />

And inside it, let's create a `mesh basic` node:

<DocImage src="docs/import_assets/create_mesh_basic_mat_node.jpg" alt="Create a Mesh Basic node" />

For the `mesh basic` node's parameters, go to the `texture` tab, and toggle `useMap` on.

<DocImage src="docs/import_assets/set_mesh_basic_texture.jpg" alt="Activate texture" />

Then click on the yellow button that just appears. This will open a model window to select the texture node you imported previously.

<DocImage src="docs/import_assets/click_on_select_node_button.jpg" alt="Click on Select Node Button" />

<DocImage src="docs/import_assets/select_texture.jpg" alt="Select the texture node" />

And once you've selected the texture node, you can see that the value of the parameter `map` has been updated. The texture is now assigned!

<DocImage src="docs/import_assets/texture_path_is_added.jpg" alt="The texture is assigned" />

Now the last step is to assign this material to an object.

So go back to the top again:

<DocImage src="docs/import_assets/go_to_top.jpg" alt="Go to top" />

And go into `/geo1` where you had created the file node. The create a `sphere` node, as well as a `material` node. Plug the sphere node into the material node.

Then select the material node to show up its parameters. And in the `material` parameter, you will see a similar yellow button to select a node. Use it to select the `mesh basic` you just created. And that's it! The material is now assigned, with the texture you have imported. All done!

## From your local drive

And just like [importing models](/docs/assets/models) from a url, importing textures from a remote url isn't the most convenient. This is where the [local version](/install) can also help you.

<DocVideo src="docs/import_assets/import_textures_from_local" alt="import textures from local" />

As you can see, the `url` param of the `cop/image` node also has a `file browse` button just next to it. And it will allow you to quickly pick textures that are under the `public` folder.
