# [Export](/export) / To Codesandbox

First open the export panel with the dropdown menu `File -> Export`.

Then you can choose any of those configuration:

-   vanilla
-   threejs
-   vue
-   react
-   react three fiber

And you're done, your scene is now on codesandbox!

You can then inspect which files needed to load your scene, and modify them using the [API](/docs/api) if needed.

Here it is in action:

<DocVideo src="docs/first_scene/example2_export" alt="Export a scene" />

Let's now have a look at <DocRouterLink bang href="/docs/export/local!" innerText="How to Export your scene locally &rarr;"></DocRouterLink>
