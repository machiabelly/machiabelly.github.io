# Your First Scene

## Start with the Examples

The easiest way to get a sense of how Polygonjs can help you is by trying the [example scenes](/examples).

Have a look at the current [list of examples](/examples) and simply pick any of them.

## Export the scene

One of the first thing you may want to do is export the scene. This will show you how easy it can be integrated into your own website.

As you can see in this video, you can export straight to Codesandbox, in just 1 click. Can't be easier!

And you can export using several front end framework:

-   vanilla
-   threejs
-   vue
-   react
-   react three fiber

Note that this is just one way to export a scene. We will see later how to [install Polygonjs](/install) on your computer, so you can simply save the files locally.

## Checkout out how a scene is created

A great advantages of scenes that are fully node-based like in Polygonjs is that they are very easy to deconstruct and understand. You can go back in the node tree and see what each node does, step by step.

In this video below, we are doing the following steps:

1. We change the camera, so that we can move around without the FPS controls
2. We switch the **display flag** from the bottom most node to the node `box1` at the top. The **display flag** defines which node is added to the scene. Since `box1` creates a box, all we now see is... just a box.
3. We switch the display flag to other nodes. First to `box2`, which shows another box. Then to `merge1`, where things get interesting, as you can see we now see both boxes together.
4. Then we switch to the copy node `copy1`, which duplicates its input. This is what creates a staircase.
5. We keep going switch the display flag to other nodes down, which makes the result increasingly more interesting.

## What's next?

While you can do a lot with Polygonjs online, using it locally is much easier. So let's look at <DocRouterLink bang href="/docs/install!" innerText="Installing Polygonjs &rarr;"></DocRouterLink>
