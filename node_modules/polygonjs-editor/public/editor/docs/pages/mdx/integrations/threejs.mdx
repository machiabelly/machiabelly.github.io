# [Integrations](integrations) / Threejs

The easiest way to start a Threejs + Polygonjs project is by using our create cli tool:

<DocCodeBlock npm="npm create polygonjs@latest -t three" yarn="yarn create polygonjs -t three"></DocCodeBlock>

Or if you would like you use typescript, you can also use:

<DocCodeBlock npm="npm create polygonjs@latest -t three-ts" yarn="yarn create polygonjs -t three-ts"></DocCodeBlock>

And then you can simply follow the prompt, and a starter template will be created for you.
