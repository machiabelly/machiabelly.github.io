# [Integrations](integrations) / Git

Polygonjs only exports text files, and therefore integrates with git perfectly.

You can save scenes from the editor, and track diffs line by line, as only the relevant changes are saved to disk.

# .gitignore

When you create a project with [our scaffolding utility](/install/new), polygonjs create a `.gitignore` file for you. But if you add it to an existing project, it will not change it. In that case, you would need to add the following to it:

```txt
node_modules/
build/
public/polygonjs/backup
public/polygonjs/js
public/polygonjs/build
.polygonjs-editor.log
# When more than one person is working on a scene,
# it may be useful to also ignore the editor.json
# to avoid any merge conflict
# public/polygonjs/scenes/[a-z0-9\_]*/editor.json
```
