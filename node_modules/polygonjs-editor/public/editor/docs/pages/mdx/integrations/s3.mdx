# [Integrations](integrations) / AWS S3

Polygonjs allows you to upload your exported scene online, which then allows you to load it on website builders like [Webflow](/docs/integrations/webflow).

# What is AWS S3?

AWS S3 is a file storage service. AWS stands for Amazon Web Services, and S3 stands for Simple Storage Service. It is a service that allows you to store files online, and access them from anywhere.

# How do I upload my project to AWS S3?

If you haven't done so yet, start by the [install](/docs/install) and [export](/docs/export) guides, and come back here once you've followed the steps then.

Once you've read those pages, here is how to upload the build of your project:

## Set up your .env file

First, you can see that you have an `.env` file at the root of your project. This project is where you can store any passwords or credentials that you do not want to share with anyone.

Here we are going to set credentials for you AWS account, where the files will be uploaded. If you do not have an account yet, you can create one [here](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/).

Once you've done so, you can read their [getting started page](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/GetStartedWithS3.html) to get a sense of how to set it up.

It may appear more complicated than it should be. All that you should do is create a folder (which they call a bucket), and sub folders inside, and grab your credentials.

Once you have them, add them to the relevant fields in the `.env` file:

```bash
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=XXXXXXXXXXXXXX
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=XXXXXXXXXXXXXX
AWS_REGION=XXXXXXXXXXXXXX
BUCKET_NAME=XXXXXXXXXXXXXX
BUCKET_FOLDER=projects/my-project
SCENE_NAME=test_01
VERSION=01
```

## Run build_s3

You can see a command in your `package.json`, call `build_s3`. This will build your project and upload it. So simply run this one:

<DocCodeBlock npm="npm run build_s3" yarn="yarn build_s3"></DocCodeBlock>

On a default scene, it should take a few seconds to build and upload.

Once it is done, you will see a prompt describing:

-   The url at which you can play the uploaded 3D scene.
-   The embed code to add to Webflow or similar site builder.

It looks like this:

```bash
Upload Completed! (total 30 files)

-- Open Scene:                           https://your-polygonjs-exports.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/projects/.../v01/index.html

-- Embed Code (ie: Webflow.com):         <script type='module' ...
```

And that's it. Simply grab the embed code, and add it to your website builder.

## Uploading a new version

As you can see in the `.env` above, you have access to several fields like `BUCKET_FOLDER`, `SCENE_NAME` and `VERSION`. If you change any of those, your files will be uploaded to a new folder.

So the recommended way to use it is change the version number when you've made substantial changes. And simply run the `build_s3` command again.

You'll see that the embed code will also be updated with the new version number, so make sure to update those as well.
