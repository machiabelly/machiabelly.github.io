# [Using The Editor](/docs/editor) / Node Network

The Network Panel is where you can view and connect all the nodes you want in your scene.

We'll document what you can do here more in depth in the future, but in the mean time, here are the key shortcuts:

-   `TAB`: open the nodes list, from which you can select and create nodes.
-   `i`: enter selected node
-   `u`: exit selected node
-   `Ctrl+z`: undo
-   `Ctrl+y`: redo
-   `Ctrl+c` / `ctrl+v`: copy and paste nodes (learn more about [copy/paste](/docs/editor/copy_paste))
-   `Ctrl+x` / `ctrl+v`: cut and paste nodes
-   `Ctrl+b`: view panel in full screen
-   `Ctrl+p`: opens a node search input field, useful to quickly jump to another node
-   `Ctrl+i`: toggle the code preview panel
-   `Ctrl+9`: toggle the params stack panel
-   `Ctrl+0`: toggle the scene tree

The `WASD` keys can be very useful to enter/exit the nodes as well:

-   `w`: enter selected node
-   `s`: exit selected node
-   `a`: go back
-   `d`: go forward

The Arrow keys help play/pause the scene:

-   `up arrow` and `down arrow`: toggle pause/play
-   `right arrow`: move 1 frame forward
-   `left arrow`: move 1 frame back

You can also use the following keys for the most basic actions:

-   `x`: display the selected node
-   `b`: bypass the selected node

And use the mouse to pan/zoom/select:

-   `left button click on a node`: select the node
-   `left button drag`: select multiple nodes
-   `left button + ctrl, and drag`: pan
-   `middle button and drag`: pan
-   `middle click on a node`: open a popup previewing the node content
-   `mouse wheel`: zoom in/out
-   `right click on a node`: open a node context menu

**TIPS**:

There are 2 ways to connect nodes faster when you create them for the first time:

-   If you hover your mouse over an existing node connection and then click to create the node, it will connect right away.
-   If you press Ctrl as you create a node, it will connect to the previously selected node.
