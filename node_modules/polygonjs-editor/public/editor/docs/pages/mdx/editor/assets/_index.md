With the [local app](/docs/install), Polygonjs detects when assets used by your scene are updated. It then reloads the parameter loading that assets, and the nodes depending on it recompute.

In this video, you see a [sop/dataUrl](/docs/nodes/sop/dataUrl) node that loads a json file `data/test.json`. This node then drives a [sop/copy](/docs/nodes/sop/copy), which creates a sphere on the points created by the dataUrl.

On the right, the file `data/test.json` is updated with a text editor. As soon as the file is saved, Polygonjs detects it, and recomputes the nodes. There is no need to hit the reload button or refresh the page.
