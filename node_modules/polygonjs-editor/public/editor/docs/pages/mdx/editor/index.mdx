# Using The Editor

The visual editor is a powerful way to create your scene, and gives you an immediate view of any change you make.

It is composed of several panels, that each specialize in specific tasks:

-   [Node Network](editor/network)
-   [Viewer](editor/viewer)
-   [Params](editor/params)
-   [Scene Tree](editor/scenetree)
-   [Spreadsheet](editor/spreadsheet)
-   [Code Preview](editor/codepreview)
-   [Performance](editor/performance)

It is also possible to configure various aspect of the editor using the file `src/polygonjs/EditorConfig.ts`. Learn more about [Configuring the Editor ➡️](editor/config)
