# [Using The Editor](/docs/editor) / Viewer

The Viewer is where you can view and interact with your 3D scene.

<DocImage src="docs/editor/panels/viewer.jpg" alt="Polygonjs Viewer Panel" />

when you have selected either a [sop/transform](/docs/nodes/sop/transform), or any node at the [obj](/docs/nodes/obj) level, such as the [obj/geo](/docs/nodes/obj/geo), from the [network panel](/docs/editor/network), a transform control will show up.

You can then switch this transform control mode with the following keys:

-   `E`: scale
-   `R`: rotate
-   `T`: translate
-   `Q`: toggle between local and world space

Additionally, you can also use the following shortcut:

-   `Ctrl+b`: view panel in full screen
