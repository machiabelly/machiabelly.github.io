# Copy & Pasting Nodes

<DocVideo src="docs/getting_started/copy_paste/copy_paste" alt="copy & paste" />

Copy/Pasting nodes is a key feature of node-based apps like Polygonjs. So we made sure that it works as intuitively as possible.

Therefore, all you have to do is:

-   select the nodes you want to duplicate.
-   copy them press `CTRL + c` on windows/linux, or `CMD + c` on mac.
-   and paste them with `CTRL + v` on windows/linux, or `CMD + v` on mac.

And not only can you copy/paste nodes within the same scene, but you can also **copy them from one scene, and paste them in another**. This is incredibly useful when looking at the [example scenes](/docs/examples) and using those in your own scenes.

In most cases, it is as simple as that. But since Polygonjs runs in browsers, and browsers have a lot of security protections,

## Troubleshooting

The very first time you try and copy/paste nodes, you'll see this permission request:

<DocImage src="docs/getting_started/copy_paste/copy_paste_permission_request.jpg" alt="Editor shell output" />

If you accept, the underlying code that runs the copy/paste will do its job just fine. But chances you are that when this request appeared, you just want to move on and you declined it in a heard beat.

_I know because that's exactly what I do when I see one!_

But that's okay, starting from version `1.2.33-4`, the copy/paste has been made more flexible and will work mostly fine. There are only 3 situations where you need to grand this permission:

-   You use a version older than `1.2.33-4`
-   You want to copy from [the web editor to the local editor](/docs/install), or vice-versa.
-   You want to copy between local editors running on different ports (for instance localhost:8091 and localhost:8092)

In order to do grant this permission, you should go into your browser settings. The instructions will change depending if you use chrome, firefox or safari, but here are below some links you can use.

The permission you need to allow is for the `Clipboard`.

-   chrome: [https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/114662?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform=Desktop](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/114662?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform=Desktop) or [chrome://settings/content/clipboard](chrome://settings/content/clipboard)

-   firefox: [https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/site-permissions-panel](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/site-permissions-panel)

-   safari: [https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/safari/ibrwe2159f50/mac](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/safari/ibrwe2159f50/mac)

And once you've done that, reload the page and copy/paste should work just like the video at the top of this page.
