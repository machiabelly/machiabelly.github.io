# [Install Polygonjs](/install) / Create a New Project

You can quickly create a project with our scafolling command line tool:

<DocCodeBlock npm="npm create polygonjs@latest" yarn="yarn create polygonjs"></DocCodeBlock>

Then follow the prompts!

You'll be able to choose the **project name**, as well as **a template**, which can be one of the following:

-   vanilla
-   Threejs
-   Vuejs
-   React
-   React Three Fiber

Those templates can give you a quick integration to your framework of choice.

You'll also be able to choose between javascript and typescript.

Once this is done, you will see instructions to complete the installation, and you will be able to start Polygonjs Editor with:

<DocCodeBlock npm="npm run polygon" yarn="yarn polygon"></DocCodeBlock>

## Using arguments

You can also directly specify the project name and the template you want to use via additional command line options. For example, you can scaffold a react project like this:

<DocCodeBlock
	npm="npm create polygonjs@latest my-polygon-project -t react"
	yarn="yarn create polygonjs my-polygon-project -t react"
></DocCodeBlock>

Here is the list of templates you can use: `vanilla`, `vanilla-ts`, `vue`, `vue-ts`, `react`, `react-ts`, `react-three-fiber`, `react-three-fiber-ts`, `threejs`, `threejs-ts`.
