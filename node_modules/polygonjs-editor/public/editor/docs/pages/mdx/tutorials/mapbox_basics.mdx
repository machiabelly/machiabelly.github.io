# [Tutorials](/docs/tutorials) / Mapbox Basics

Mapbox is an application that allows you to display many different types of data on a map, and Polygonjs has a [plugin](https://github.com/polygonjs/plugin-mapbox) to help add 3D models to it.

And of course, you would not be limited to static models, as you can use all the nodes that Polygonjs offers to manipulate those geometries. It would then be easy to create custom shaders and add custom interactions.
