## Uploading Textures and Models

Importing assets on Polygonjs is very easy. Here is a quick demo on how to import an image and use it as a texture.

## Compressing Assets

Depending on the size of your assets, you will also need to ensure they are as small as possible.

### Models

Reducing your models can be done with the [gltf-pipeline](https://github.com/AnalyticalGraphicsInc/gltf-pipeline).

Here are the compression settings that I regularly use:

```sh
gltf-pipeline -i input.gltf -o output.gltf -d --binary --secure --stats --draco.compressionLevel 10 --draco.quantizePositionBits 14 --draco.quantizeNormalBits 10 --draco.quantizeTexcoordBits 12
```

And if you need to convert to gltf first, what you will need may depend on the initial format of your model. If it is an `.obj` file, you may want to use [obj2gltf](https://github.com/AnalyticalGraphicsInc/obj2gltf)

```sh
obj2gltf -i scene_mesh_decimated_textured.obj
```
