# Upgrade Polygonjs

Since Polygonjs is just an npm module, you can decide which version you want from the `package.json` file:

```json
{
	"dependencies": {
		"polygonjs-editor": "1.1.280-1"
	}
}
```

When you update this file, make sure to actually install it with:.

<DocCodeBlock npm="npm install" yarn="yarn"></DocCodeBlock>

And now, when you start Polygonjs wit the usual command, it will launch using that new version.

<DocCodeBlock npm="npm run polygon" yarn="yarn polygon"></DocCodeBlock>
