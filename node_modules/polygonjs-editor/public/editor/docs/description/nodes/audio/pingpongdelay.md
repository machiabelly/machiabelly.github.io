PingPongDelay is a feedback delay effect where the echo is heard
first in one channel and next in the opposite channel. In a stereo
system these are the right and left channels.
PingPongDelay in more simplified terms is two Tone.FeedbackDelays
with independent delay values. Each delay is routed to one channel
(left or right), and the channel triggered second will always
trigger at the same interval after the first.
