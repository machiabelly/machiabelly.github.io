applies a noise

@remark

This node is very powerful and can be used to affect many parts of a shader, or even generate forces in a particle system.
It can also create fbm effects, where several layers of noise are added to each other, giving a fractal effect.

Another very interesting use case is to use multiple noise nodes, where a first one is used to modify the input position of a second one.
This is called domain warping and can help you create very complex effect quickly.
