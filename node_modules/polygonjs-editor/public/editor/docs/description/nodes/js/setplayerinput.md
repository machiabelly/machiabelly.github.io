	<td><div class='bg-emerald-800 px-2 py-px text-white rounded-sm'>boolean</div></td>
	<td>stopEventsPropagation: even though this node can intercept keydown and keyup events, you may encounter situations where pressing spare or arrow keys would trigger a page scroll. This node currently does not handle those situation, and it is recommended to manually intercept those and call event.stopImmediatePropagation() and event.stopPropagation() on keypress events</td>
