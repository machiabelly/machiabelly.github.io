Resets the center of a geometry.


## Description

This can be useful when importing an object whose centroid is not at the center of the geometry. When using this geometry via the LOD SOP, the center of the object will be used to calculate the distance from the object to the camera. It is then necessary to ensure that the center of the object and the center of the geometry are as close to each other as possible.

This node can operate in one of multiple modes:

- reset_object: this will set the transform of objects to t=0,0,0, r=0,0,0 and s=0,0,0
- center geometry: centers the geometry on the center of its object
- center geometry & transform object: moves the object so that its position matches the center of the geometry, and updates the geometry position so that it stays in the same place
